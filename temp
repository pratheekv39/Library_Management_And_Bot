Dear Insurance Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the Medical ID cards recently issued. Out of the three cards received, the date of birth printed on my card is incorrect.

Kindly review and correct the DOB on the affected card at the earliest convenience. If any additional information or documentation is required from my side to facilitate this correction, please let me know.

Looking forward to your prompt assistance on this matter.
